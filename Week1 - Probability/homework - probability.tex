\section{Probability}

\textbf{Exercise 1}
To evaluate a new test for detecting Hansen’s disease, a group of people 5\% of which are known to have Hansen’s disease are tested. The test finds Hansen’s disease among 98\% of those with the disease and 3\% of those who don’t. What is the probability that someone testing positive for Hansen’s disease under this new test actually has it? \\
    
Solution 1 : \\
P(disease) = 0.05 \newline
$P(positive \mid disease) = 0.98$ \newline
$P(positive \mid not disease) = 0.03$ \newline
$P(disease \mid positive) = ??$ \\
$$ P(disease \mid positive) = \frac{P(positive \mid disease) \times P(disease)}{P(positive)} $$
$P(positive) =  P(positive \mid disease) \times P(disease) + P(positive \mid not disease) \times P(not disease)$ \\
$            = 0.98 \times 0.05 + 0.95 \times 0.03$ \\
$            = 0.0775$
$$ => P(disease \mid positive) = \frac{0.98 \times 0.05}{0.0775} = 0.632$$


\textbf{Exercise 2} Proof the following distributions are normalized then calculate the mean and standard deviation of these distribution:\\
1. Univariate normal distribution.\\
2. (Optional) Multivariate normal distribution.\\
